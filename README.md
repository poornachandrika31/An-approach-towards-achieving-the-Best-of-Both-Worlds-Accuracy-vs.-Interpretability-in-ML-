# Achieving-the-Best-of-Both-Worlds-Accuracy-vs.-Interpretability-in-ML-
Project Overview

This project applies various machine learning models to predict:

Wine Quality using physicochemical properties.

Income Classification using the Adult Income dataset.

It evaluates models based on accuracy and interpretability, leveraging Pareto Optimization to identify the best trade-off between both metrics.
